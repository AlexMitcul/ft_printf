This project is designed to help improve my programming skills.
It is a pretty straightforward task, in which I have to recode the printf function.
Through this project, I will learn about variadic functions and how to implement them. Once I successfully validate my implementation of printf, I will be able to reuse it in future projects. This exercise will introduce me to a popular and versatile C function called printf, and it is considered to be of moderate difficulty. Overall, this project will be a great opportunity for me to strengthen my skills and gain a deeper understanding of this important function.
